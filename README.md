# 📊 Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Prediction Using Python

## 📝 Description
This project focuses on predicting Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) using real-world retail transaction data. CLV estimates the total future revenue a customer is expected to generate, enabling businesses to make informed decisions related to marketing, customer retention, and customer strategy.

The project applies probabilistic customer behavior models to move beyond descriptive analytics and provide future-oriented insights.

## 📈 Visualizations
- CLV distribution  
- Purchase frequency vs CLV  
- Monetary value vs CLV  
- Average CLV by segment  

---

## 🔍 Key Insights
- CLV distribution is highly right-skewed
- A small group of customers contributes most future revenue
- Purchase frequency is a strong driver of CLV
- CLV segmentation supports targeted marketing strategies
